Project Title üìú Blockchain-Based Certificate System

Description üìù This project, titled "Online Blockchain-Based Certificate
Generation and Validation," aims to revolutionize the traditional method
of certificate issuance and verification by leveraging blockchain
technology. Our solution enhances security, reduces fraud, and
simplifies the validation process for educational and professional
certificates.

Features ‚ú® Secure Certificate Storage: Certificates are stored on the
Ethereum blockchain, ensuring immutability and security.

Tamper-Proof: The immutability of the blockchain makes certificates
tamper-proof.

Smart Contracts: Automate the issuance process, ensuring certificates
are issued only when criteria are met.

Unique Identifiers: Each certificate is associated with a unique hash
and can be easily verified using a URL or QR code.

Efficient Verification: Organizations can verify certificates quickly
and reliably using our platform.

Technologies Used ‚öôÔ∏è Frontend: \[List frontend technologies, e.g.,
React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript\]

Backend: \[List backend technologies, e.g., Node.js, Flask, Python\]

Blockchain: \[List blockchain technologies, e.g., Ethereum, Solidity\]

Development Tools: \[List development tools, e.g., Truffle, Hardhat,
MetaMask\]
